## BINARY SEARCH
Searching is one of the humane things we do in our daily life, Fortunately, we are evolved species and we sort of have an idea how to efficiently do things [by things I mean "Searching" for the sake of this topic]. 
For example:
* To look for a word in a dictionary, You don't just start going through each word until you find the word you are looking for.
  In fact, the dictionary is designed in a specific way so that we can find the word we are looking for fast-ly and efficiently.
  * Ya, you guessed it right, the dictionary is sort of a Data Structure [Not just data!, It is Structured in a specific way to help us implement an algorithm to find the word we are looking for].
* So, now you know that the words in the dictionary are *sorted*, so by this, you figure out where the word would be in the dictionary.
* Hopefully, you will approximate the word to be present in any one half of the dictionary ie.. you pull up the dictionary from the middle[approx.] and then decide if you should search in the first half or the second half.
* And you repeat the above process until you find the word.

_Guess what? 
You just did a Binary Search_.

So, now you know what binary search is, All we have to do is just tell it to a computer.
